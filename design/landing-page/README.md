# Landing page directions — fifty calm fronts

Open `index.html` in a browser to review 50 landing directions. The gallery is searchable, filterable by family, previewable in both themes, and supports a shortlist of up to four (persisted per browser).

The set is distilled from the shortlisted **001 "Atelier Split"** of the earlier 20-direction round. Every concept keeps one fixed hierarchy and differs only in composition:

- bare Orbit mark (no container chip);
- serif title → one line → one action → calm recents;
- no feature lists, no drop hints, no runtime picker.

Every concept shares the Orbit paper system:

- System UI stack (`-apple-system`) + `Cormorant Garamond` serif for the hero title only (`_welcome.scss:11`);
- Cream `#fbf7ec` / `#f4eee1` / `#eee5d4` and sage `#617a68` tokens (`_foundation.scss:75`, `_foundation.scss:109`);
- Hairline borders `rgba(43,33,25,0.05–0.15)`, pill radii `999px` / `16` / `20`, and `var(--bg-hover)` washes — no heavy card stacks or plastic shadows;
- Title weights 400–525, sizes 26–110px in mock scale (real hero is `clamp(48,5vw,68)` at 500).

Runtime selection lives in **Settings → Model → Agent runtime** (`src/renderer/src/components/SettingsPage.tsx:161`). No mock includes a runtime picker.

## Regenerate

```sh
node design/landing-page/build-concepts.mjs      # main gallery: concepts/*.html, landing-pages.css, index.html
node design/landing-page/build-iterations.mjs    # deep dives: iterations/*.html + iterations/iterations.css
```

The concepts script emits `concepts/*.html`, `landing-pages.css`, and `index.html`, and removes stale concept pages plus the legacy `landing-pages.js`. The iterations script emits four galleries (`iterations/td|gp|pq|wm.html`) sharing `iterations/iterations.css`; it links them from the main gallery's "Deep dives" strip.

## Iteration sets — 4 × 50 deep dives

Each set keeps its parent direction's soul while making large structural moves; every iteration surfaces more than recent sessions (workspaces, switchers, pulse) displayed quietly.

- **Twin Desk ×50** (`iterations/td.html`) — the right desk becomes a switcher: dropdown heads, segmented tabs, drawers, rails, accordions, trees, command palettes, split-flap boards, portals.
- **Graph Paper ×50** (`iterations/gp.html`) — grids as instruments: plotters, radar sweeps, drafting tables, oscilloscopes, string art, survey plats, one fixed-ink night lab.
- **Plaque ×50** (`iterations/pq.html`) — a small panel before the main app: gates, docks, thresholds, airlocks, turnstiles, beacons — never taking the whole surface.
- **Watermark ×50** (`iterations/wm.html`) — the ghost mark grows a supporting cast: double exposures, waterlines, seals, auroras, sonar rings, archive fans.

Iteration galleries are searchable, theme-aware, and share the four-slot shortlist (ids like `td-07`).

## Files

- `build-concepts.mjs` — generator: 50 concept definitions + emitters (run to regenerate everything below)
- `index.html` — gallery (search, family filter, theme toggle, four-slot shortlist, deep-dive links)
- `landing-pages.css` — shared tokens/components + the 50 scoped sections
- `concepts/001.html` … `050.html` — standalone previews per concept
- `build-iterations.mjs` — generator: the 4 × 50 iteration sets + gallery shells
- `iterations/td.html`, `gp.html`, `pq.html`, `wm.html` — deep-dive galleries
- `iterations/iterations.css` — tokens/components + all 200 scoped iteration sections

IDs are stable `001`–`050`. The legacy `landing-pages.js` data module was removed; both galleries are fully static.
